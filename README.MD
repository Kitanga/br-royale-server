# BR Game test

This is the nodejs server for my game. You can see the client (here)[https://github.com/Kitanga/br-royale-client].

**WARNING**: You need to setup the server before setting up the client otherwise the client will fail.
**WARNING 2**: Please keep in mind that this was mainly a side project, which means that the code can be a bit "weird" (e.g. respawn when you kill someone respawns you)

## Starting the server

Just run `node server.js` and the server we'll wait for a player to connect.
